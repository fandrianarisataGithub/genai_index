Artificial Intelligence is developing day by day, and after the introduction of Generative AI is taking creativity to the next level Generative AI is a subset of Deep learning that is again a part of Artificial Intelligence.\\xa0\\nIn this article, we will explore,\\xa0\\n\\nWhat is Generative AI? Examples, Definition, Models and limitations.\\n\\nGenerative AI helps to create new artificial content or data that includes Images, Videos, Music, or even 3D models without any effort required by humans. The advancements in LLM have led to the development of Generative AI.\\xa0\\nGenerative AI models are trained and learn the datasets and design within the data based on large datasets and Patterns. They can generate new examples that are similar to the training data. These models are capable of generating new content without any human instructions.\\nIn simple words, It generally involves training AI models to understand different patterns and structures within existing data and using that to generate new original data.\\nWorking of Generative Model\\nWhat are Generative Models?\\nA generative model is a type of machine learning model that is used to generate new data instances that are similar to those in a given dataset. It learns the underlying patterns and structures of the training data before generating fresh samples as compared to properties. Image synthesis, text generation, and music composition are all tasks that use generative models.\\xa0\\nThey are capable of capturing the features and complexity of the training data, allowing them to generate innovative and diverse outputs. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Autoregressive models, and Transformers are some examples of popular generative model architectures these models help to create new data that helps users in different aspects. These models have applications in creative activities, data enrichment, and difficult problem-solving in a variety of domains.\\n1. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)\\nThe Generative Adversarial Network is a type of machine learning model that creates new data that is similar to an existing dataset. It was proposed by Lan Googfellow in 2014. GANs generally involve two neural networks.- The Generator and The Discriminator. The Generator generates new data samples, while the Discriminator verifies the generated data. This design is influenced by ideas from game theory, a branch of mathematics concerned with the strategic interactions between different entities.\\xa0\\nThe two networks are trained together in a process in which the Generator attempts to fool the Discriminator into thinking the generated data is real, while the Discriminator attempts to accurately detect whether the data is real or fake. This process is repeated until the Generator becomes so good at providing realistic data that the Discriminator can no longer distinguish the difference.GANs can be used for image synthesis, style transfer, data augmentation, and other tasks.\\n2. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)\\nAs compared to GANs it follows a different approach. This transforms the given input data into newly generated data through a process involving both encoding and decoding. The encoder transforms input data into a lower-dimensional latent space representation, while the decoder reconstructs the original data from the latent space. Through training, VAEs learn to generate data that resembles the original inputs while exploring the latent space. Some of the applications of VAEs are Image Generation, anomaly detection, and latent space exploration.\\n3. Autoregressive models\\nAutoregressive models are a type of generative model that is used in Generative AI to generate sequences of data\\xa0like text, music, or time series data. These models generate data one element at a time, considering the context of previously generated elements. Based on the element that came before it, autoregressive models forecast the next element in the sequence.\\n4. Transformers\\nTransformers have transformed Generative AI by introducing a highly effective architecture for tasks like language translation, Text Generation(like the GPT series), and even image synthesis.\\xa0Here is an overview of the main components of the transformer architecture:\\n\\nEncoder-Decoder Structure: The transformer’s architecture is divided into an encoder and a decoder. The encoder processes the input sequence and the decoder processes that sequence.\\xa0\\nMulti-Head Attention: Multi-head attention captures diverse dependencies and features by considering different aspects of the input sequence simultaneously.\\nPositional Encodings: Unlike RNNs, Transformers do not have built-in word sense. Positional encodings are added to input embeddings to represent the places of words within a sequence.\\nTransformer Decoder: The decoder uses additional self-attention that focuses on the previously generated words in the output sequence to ensure coherence.\\nPosition-wise Feedforward Networks in Decoder: Positional encodings include Feed-Forward layers, which are included in both the encoder and the decoder and help to\\xa0capture contextual information.\\n\\nHowever, there are various hybrids, extensions, and modifications of the above models. There are specialized different unique models designed for niche applications or specific data types. As AI is continually evolving newer approaches might evolve around it.\\nWhat are Examples of Generative AI tools?\\n\\nArt and Music: Generative AI tools help to create pictures that show the beauty of art and also compose music in multiple styles. One such application is DeepArt or DeepDream tool which helps find and enhance patterns images. by using a Convolutional Neural Network. For music, there is one tool MuseNet is a deep learning model that can compose music in multiple styles.\\nText Generation: Generative AI extended its powers to text generation, It produces human-like content that is based on the given input by the user. Gpt-3 developed by Open AI is one such application that can generate text as per the need of the user such as content creation, programming help, and numerous applications.\\nDeepfake Creation: There is one of the most famous technologies of generative AI is Deepfake which uses GANs to swap faces in videos. It is an image or a video recording that uses an algorithm to replace the person in the original video or image with someone else.\\nGame Development: Generative AI is also used in game development, AI Dungeon is a text-based adventure game that uses the GPT-3 to generate a dynamic storyline that is based on user input.\\nDrug Discovery: Prediction of the efficacy and toxicity of the drug compound is one of the main parts of AI in medicinal chemistry.\\n3D Object Generation: Generative AI assists in object generation. Generative AI tools like NVIDIA’s GauGAN allow users to create 3D landscapes by drawing simple handmade sketches and pictures.\\n\\nWhat is Chat GPT, Google Bard, and DALL-E?\\n\\nChatgpt: ChatGPT is an NLP tool that is driven by AI technology. It allows you to have human-like conversations and much more features with the help of a chatbot. This model can answer any questions and assist you with any task related to development, programming, gaming, composing essays, email, etc. It generates responses based on different patterns and structures it has learned during the training. ChatGPT got trained with the various range of internet text and then it uses the Machine Learning Model to transform input text to output text accordingly.\\nGoogle Bard: Google Bard is a tool that helps developers and other data enthusiasts. It provides answers to users’ various queries quickly and usually within seconds. It works according to the user’s queries by the history saved previously asked by the users. Google Bard is an LLM chatbot that is based on LaMBDA. It helps to develop interactive dashboards and different charts easily. It can perform various tasks such as language translation, creating content, and answering different queries.\\nDALL-E: It is a new tool that generally helps to create new images with text-to-graphic prompts. By using GPT-3 and getting trained on a given dataset, DALL-E can produce images that don’t even exist. If you asked Dall-E to produce an image according to your imagination, It can create that image with certain accuracy and proper alignment.\\n\\nGenerative AI Vs AI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCriteria\\n\\n\\nGenerative AI\\n\\n\\nAI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPurpose\\nIt is designed to produce new content or data.\\nDesigned for a wide range of tasks but not limited to generation.\\n\\n\\nApplication\\nArt creation, text generation, video synthesis, and so on.\\nData analysis, predictions, automation, robotics, etc.\\n\\n\\nLearning\\nUses Unsupervised learning or reinforcement learning.\\nCan use supervised, semi-supervised, or reinforcement\\n\\n\\nOutcome\\nNew or original output is created.\\nCan produce an answer and make a decision, classify, data, etc.\\n\\n\\nComplexity\\nIt requires a complex model like GANs\\nIt has ranged from simple linear regression to complex neural networks.\\n\\n\\nData Requirement\\nRequired a large amount of data to produce results of high-quality data.\\nData requirements may vary; some need little data, and some need vast amounts.\\n\\n\\nInteractivity\\nCan be interactive, responding to user input.\\nMight not always be interactive, depending on the application.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat are the benefits of Generative AI?\\nHere are some benefits of generative AI:\\n\\nEnhancing Creativity: Generative AI is nowadays removing boundaries between human and machine creativity.
